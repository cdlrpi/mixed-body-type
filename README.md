This repository is for the investigation of using the DCA to form and solve equations of motion for a system of rigid, flexible, and highly flexible bodies.  It is proposed that the GEBF, because it uses rotational coordinates as does the other bodies, will allow formation of system level equations of motion.  The "two-handle" equations of motion are generated for a GEBF element such that the standard DCA operations can be used to form and solve the equations of motion for a system of rigid bodies, flexible bodies modeled with an FFR approach, and flexible bodies modeled with GEBF. 

There is surely a mistake in the determination of the GEBF mass-matrix or body-force vector.  The rope is growing!
